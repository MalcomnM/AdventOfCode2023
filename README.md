# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions in C#

## Introduction
Welcome to my repository containing solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Advent of Code is an annual series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels. These puzzles can be solved in any programming language, and this repository focuses on solutions using .NET and C#.

The primary goal of this repository is to share my thought processes and solutions with fellow developers, particularly those in training at my firm. This initiative aims to foster learning, encourage problem-solving skills, and enhance proficiency in C# and .NET technologies.

## Structure of the Repository
Each folder in this repository corresponds to a day of the Advent of Code 2023 challenge. Inside each folder, you'll find the solution for that day's puzzle along with a detailed write-up explaining the approach, logic, and any relevant C# and .NET concepts used.
